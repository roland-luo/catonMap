# Licences, data sources and attribution

Everything on the map is built from open data. No Google, Apple, Bing or other proprietary map content
(imagery, 3D tiles, geometry) is used, not even as a reference.


## This repository

| What | Licence |
|---|---|
| Source code (`pipeline/`, `web/`, scripts) | [MIT](LICENSE) |
| Map imagery (published tiles), `video/`, `pipeline/style/` | [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) by Dmytro Krasun, **plus the data credits below**, which must be kept with any copy |

The imagery and videos are *Produced Works* under the ODbL (see OpenStreetMap below): their own licence is
free to choose, but the OpenStreetMap notice must stay with them. AI-painted images may not be protected by
copyright everywhere; where they are, CC BY 4.0 applies.

## Credit line

Shown on the map (footer), in video mode and on every clip; use it on reposts, captions and end cards:

> Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors · Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality · Terrain: Copernicus DEM © DLR, Airbus DS · Painted with AI

Each region lists its own credit lines in `pipeline/src/places.ts` (`credits`). Shanghai uses the same data
sources without the municipal layer:

> Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors · Shanghai · Terrain: Copernicus DEM © DLR, Airbus DS · Cel-shaded cartoon render

Chengdu · Longquanyi uses OSM + Copernicus only as well:

> Map data © OpenStreetMap contributors · Chengdu · Longquanyi · Terrain: Copernicus DEM © DLR, Airbus DS · Cel-shaded cartoon render

None of this data is in the repository: `npm run fetch` downloads it into `data/` (ignored by git).

## AI painting

Render tiles are repainted by OpenAI's image model through the Codex CLI (ChatGPT account). OpenAI's terms
assign the output rights to the user. No credit is required; the map and clips say "Painted with AI" because
social platforms ask for AI-generated content to be labelled.

The Shanghai and Chengdu regions are **not** painted with an image model: they are rendered with the in-repo
cel-shading pass (`render --style cartoon`), so their tiles and clips must not be labelled "Painted with AI";
they are credited as a cel-shaded render. The same applies to any region rendered with `--style cartoon`.

Everything in `pipeline/style/` was painted the same way for this project: `reference.png` (the house style,
a stretch of the painted Tel Aviv map: Gordon beach and the city behind it), `trees.png` (tree species
sheet) and `sea.png` (sea texture).
